# Choose Your Own Adventure Game — Cyberpunk Disco Elysium-Style

## Overview
A web-based, fully AI-driven choose-your-own-adventure game inspired by Disco Elysium and set in a cyberpunk world. The game features:
- Left pane: dynamically generated cyberpunk-style images (including a 2D map and scene illustrations)
- Right pane: AI-powered dialog and a Disco Elysium-style “thought cabinet” with internal monologue and choices
- Simple, point-and-click navigation on a 10x10 grid overlaying a 1024x1024 map tile
- One global world state, with each player having an autogenerated identity
- All text, images, and player decisions are stored for each run (SQLite)

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React (TypeScript, Vite)
- **Backend:** Node.js/Express (TypeScript)
- **Database:** SQLite (local server)
- **AI Integration:** OpenRouter for dialog/thoughts, frontier model (e.g., Stable Diffusion/DALL-E) for images
- **Visual Style:** Neon colors, glitch effects, dark mode, pixel art

## Core Features
- **Dynamic Map:**
  - 1024x1024 AI-generated image as the map
  - 10x10 grid (each cell 100x100px); click to move
  - Player position shown; each cell can trigger unique interactions
- **Thought Cabinet & Dialog:**
  - Fully AI-driven dialog and internal monologue
  - Thought cabinet voices appear based on player progress and hidden dice rolls
  - Player presented with choices (some basic, some chance-based)
- **Exploration Loop:**
  - Player explores the map, initiates interactions, receives thought input, makes decisions, and returns to exploration
- **Data Storage:**
  - All text, images, and player decisions are stored in SQLite for each run
  - One global world state, each player has an autogenerated identity
- **No authentication or customization in MVP; character customization can be added later**

## Implementation Plan
1. **Project Setup**
    - Scaffold React frontend (Vite + TypeScript)
    - Scaffold Node.js/Express backend (TypeScript)
    - Set up SQLite database
2. **Core UI Layout**
    - Left pane: map image + grid overlay, player marker
    - Right pane: dialog window, thought cabinet, options
3. **Backend Endpoints**
    - Generate/store/retrieve map and scene images
    - Store/retrieve narrative text and player decisions
    - Manage global world state and player identities
4. **AI Integration**
    - OpenRouter for dialog/thoughts
    - Image generation model for map and scenes
    - Draft/refine prompt templates collaboratively
5. **Game Logic**
    - Map navigation and interaction triggering
    - Thought cabinet appearance logic (progress + hidden dice rolls)
    - Decision resolution (basic and chance-based)
6. **Persistence**
    - Store all run data (text, images, decisions) in SQLite
7. **Visual Polish**
    - Neon/glitch/pixel art effects for UI and map
    - Responsive layout, dark mode
8. **Testing & Iteration**
    - Playtest flows, refine prompts, polish UX

## Future Enhancements
- Multi-tile/scrollable world map
- Player character customization
- Analytics, sharing, and replay features
- Social/world events

## Collaboration
- Prompt templates and style guidelines will be drafted and refined together during implementation.
