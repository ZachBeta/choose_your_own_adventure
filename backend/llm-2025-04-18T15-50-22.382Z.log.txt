Player history:
  [1]
    Scene: The glass gleams under the flickering neon. Silas doesn't bother with pleasantries. Just a slow, deliberate wipe, the rag leaving a faint, oily sheen. "You got a name, ghost? Or are you just another shadow drawn to the Siren's glow? Don't waste my time."
    Choice: silas_greeting
  [2]
    Scene: Silas's gaze sharpens, a flicker of something unreadable crossing her face. It vanishes as quickly as it appears, leaving behind the familiar mask of indifference. She sighs, a sound like air leaking from a punctured tire.

Player history:
  [1]
    Scene: “Waste of time,” she rasps, the words tasting like ash in the stale air. Her eyes, the color of chipped flint, don't linger. They slide past you, dismissing you as a glitch in the system, a stray data packet that needs to be purged. The silence returns, heavier now, laced with a palpable sense of…weariness. Like she’s seen it all before. Like you’re just another echo in a city full of them.
    Choice: silas_response_1
  [2]
    Scene: She regards your question with the same glacial indifference she’s displayed thus far. A flicker, almost imperceptible, crosses her face – something akin to…amusement? No. More like the brief, cold spark of a faulty circuit. She exhales, a plume of vapor momentarily obscuring the harsh neon light reflecting in her eyes. "Questions," she says, her voice a low, dry rustle, "are for the curious. And you, detective…you reek of desperation, not curiosity."
    Choice: silas_question_1
  [3]
    Scene: She doesn't react to the question itself, not really. It's the *way* you ask it, the tremor in your voice, the way your eyes dart around the room like a trapped rat. It confirms her initial assessment. You're unraveling. She leans forward, the movement slow, deliberate, like a predator assessing its prey. The neon light catches the sharp angles of her face, highlighting the weariness etched into her features. A faint, almost imperceptible smile plays on her lips – not a smile of amusement, but something colder, something…knowing.
    Choice: silas_question_2
