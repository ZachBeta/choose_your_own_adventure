📜 The rhino-man doesn't smile. Doesn't even blink. Just stares, the data-port on his temple pulsing faintly. He speaks, his voice a synthesized rumble, like gravel shifting in a forgotten landfill. "ID. Purpose."

🧠 Thought Cabinet:
  [0] Logic: Standard procedure. He's not being hostile, just…efficient. This city runs on efficiency, even when it's dripping with decay.

Player history:
  [1]
    Scene: Rain. Always rain. It slicks the neon signs, bleeds the colors into the grimy streets. You find yourself outside 'The Chrome Orchid,' a club that smells of desperation and cheap synth-booze. A bouncer, built like a chrome-plated rhino, eyes you with the weary suspicion of a man who's seen too much. He's got a data-port glinting on his temple, probably running a facial recognition scan as we speak. The air hums with a low, persistent thrum – the city breathing, or maybe just the failing generators.
