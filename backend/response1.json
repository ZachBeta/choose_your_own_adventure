Each drop seems to amplify the city's hum, a low thrum of desperation and flickering data streams. You chose 'opt1'. A risky move, even for you. The flickering neon sign above – 'The Chrome Orchid' – casts a sickly green glow on the overflowing bins and the damp pavement. You're here because of a whisper, a rumour of a data broker known only as 'Silas'. He deals in secrets, the kind that can shatter empires or buy you a new lung. The alley smells of stale synth-noodles and something…metallic. Something unsettling. You feel a prickle on the back of your neck, the familiar sensation of being watched.  The rain obscures your vision, but you can *feel* eyes on you.  A rat, sleek and augmented with chrome implants, scuttles past, its red eyes reflecting the neon. It doesn't acknowledge you.  Nothing does, yet.\",\n  \"player_state\": {\n    \"health\": 78,\n    \"sanity\": 62,\n    \"cred_balance\": 127,\n    \"inventory\": [],\n    \"status_effects\": []\n  },\n  \"options\": [\n    {\n      \"option_id\": \"opt2\",\n      \"text\": \"Attempt to hail Silas directly, using the coded phrase you were given.\",\n      \"consequence\": \"Potential encounter with Silas, risk of attracting unwanted attention.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"option_id\": \"opt3\",\n      \"text\": \"Scan the alleyway for surveillance devices or other signs of danger.\",\n      \"consequence\": \"May reveal hidden threats, but could also alert someone to your presence.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"option_id\": \"opt4\",\n      \"text\": \"Examine the overflowing bins more closely.
