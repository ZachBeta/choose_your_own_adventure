I'd really love to have a real dice rolling mechanic and visualizer so it feels more interactive, and I really do think the addition of an image, or something more compelling in the "subconscious" panel, maybe a "senses" panel, or some other abstraction

I do like the concrete experiments, though I think most of them will have a hard time tweaking to improve them, that part of the creative process is a bit "last 20% total work takes 80% total time"

Let's discuss a "micro" character creation, that can lead a player through a conversational flow with an aim to gather some firmer attributes, and some more fluid ones (a "vibe string" might be enough to capture that)

Disco Elysium asks a player first thing to choose a play style by setting some default character sheets out
Most RPGs have some kind of character sheet
Cyberpunk 2020 probably does, as well as its sibling and cousin games
We already have locked in that the game play loop we built should have a player name, and a scene - that could be worth exploring - having a tree that stores every step of the multiverse

also I had this conversation to explore the idea of a spiderman themed arm of the multiverse tree

@BodgeIt I'm building a choose your own adventure game, what kind of prompt could I use for flavor text to have the game be set in the spiderverse?

Here's a possible opening prompt:

"Reality glitches around you as the Web of Life and Destiny pulses with energy. You find yourself in a dimension where you're the chosen Spider-Person. Your spider-sense tingles, alerting you to multiple paths ahead:

[Choice 1] Follow the neon-lit skyline of a cyberpunk New York
[Choice 2] Swing towards the mysterious 1930s noir landscape
[Choice 3] Investigate the strange energy signature in a parallel Queens

Your spider-sense tells you each path holds different dangers - and possibilities. Which reality will you explore?"

This establishes the multiverse concept while giving players clear choices and maintaining the Spider-Verse atmosphere.

that's pretty hokey, maybe we need to start with character creation to set the scene

Good point! Try something like this:

"A sudden jolt. The spider's bite burns on your skin as reality shifts around you. Who were you before this moment?

[Choice 1] A student from Queens juggling responsibilities
[Choice 2] A young artist from Brooklyn with big dreams
[Choice 3] A punk rocker fighting the system
[Choice 4] A tech genius working late at Future Corp

Your origin story shapes your powers and path. The multiverse awaits - who will you become?"

This lets players establish their identity first, which can then influence their powers, costume design, and story direction.
```

so it seems like character creation is emerging as the most compelling thing to improve playability

This is a great direction! Character creation is often the most emotionally engaging and replayable part of RPGs and narrative games. It gives players agency, helps them invest, and—if designed well—can flavor the entire experience, even with a lightweight implementation.

Let’s break down your ideas and propose a concrete, “micro” character creation flow that’s both fun and extensible:

1. Micro Character Creation Flow: Conversational, Attribute + Vibe
Goal:
Guide the player through a short, conversational series of choices that establish:

A few “firm” attributes (e.g., origin, archetype, pronouns, maybe a special trait)
One or more “fluid”/flavor attributes (e.g., a “vibe string,” a quirk, or a guiding emotion)
Example Flow:

Origin Story
“Who were you before everything changed?”
[ ] A student from Queens juggling responsibilities
[ ] A punk rocker fighting the system
[ ] A tech genius working late at Future Corp
[ ] (etc.)
Core Trait or Archetype
“What’s your strongest quality?”
[ ] Clever
[ ] Brave
[ ] Chaotic
[ ] Compassionate
[ ] (etc.)
Vibe String
“Describe your vibe in a word or phrase.”
(Free text, or a few evocative options: “Brooding,” “Hopeful,” “Anxious but Determined”)
Pronouns/Name
(Optional, but helps with immersion and inclusivity)
(Optional) Quirk or Weakness
“What’s your biggest flaw or secret?”
[ ] Always late
[ ] Can’t resist a challenge
[ ] Haunted by the past
[ ] (etc.)
2. Making It Visually & Mechanically Engaging
Dice Visualizer:
After character creation, or at key moments, let the player roll a “destiny die” (or similar), with a satisfying animation and result that influences the next scene or gives a bonus/penalty.
Image/Senses Panel:
Show an evocative image or a “sensory snapshot” (e.g., “You smell rain on concrete. The city is alive with neon.”) based on choices so far.
Flavorful Feedback:
Immediately reflect chosen traits in the narrative (“As a punk rocker, you…”).
3. Implementation Notes
Short, Branching Tree:
Each choice can branch or flavor later text, but keep the initial flow short (3-5 steps).
Store Only What Matters:
Save only the final choices and “vibe string” for context; discard the rest to save space.
Replayability:
Vary opening scenes or available choices based on character creation results.
4. Spiderverse Example
Your Spiderverse convo is a great template! You could generalize it for any genre:

Start with “Who are you?” before “Where are you?”
5. Next Steps
Would you like a draft of this micro character creation flow (as a narrative script, UI wireframe, or code)?
Should we design the dice mechanic and visualizer in parallel, or focus on character creation first?
Any genres or vibes you want to prioritize for the first implementation (e.g., Spiderverse, cyberpunk, fantasy)?
Let me know your preferences, and I’ll help you prototype the next step!

I'll read through that in a second once I capture a thought
(concepts: navigating a narrative vertex space and trying to find another player character, like wikipedia traversal games - everything is philosophy (kind of like our luigi idea), or two people speedrunning from one specific page to another specific page)
when a character is introduced in a story, there are some iconic introductions, but always the opening sequence is about setting tone, vibe even

also I would love if this game is mouse/touchscreen only so it can play easily on any device, and maybe have some shortcut keys for people who would prefer a desktop/laptop 
which means we need some kind of search tree to help the character "wake up", I like the amenesia idea from Disco Elysium, the player is discovering who they are by the decisions they make, and of course there's revealable history about the character before the game started, but the opening is fully in the subconscious/conscious liminal space

the more I discuss this, the more I feel like we should have firm attributes, that the player will "wake up" to, maybe the opening screen really is "wake up", could be a nod to lots of other fiction
and through a series of multi-choice options, these attributes can be revealed and then stored (we can find a place to display a HUD, maybe the bottom pane as is convention), the "flavor" can be a simple summary of that internal conversation

Here’s a concrete, actionable plan based on your ideas and feedback, focusing on “micro” character creation, interactive dice, and improving the subconscious/conscious UI panels for a more immersive and replayable experience.

1. Micro Character Creation Flow (Conversational, Touch-Friendly)
Opening Scene: "Wake Up"

The first screen is a liminal dreamlike state (“Wake up…”), with subtle animation or visual effect.
Player is guided through a series of 3–5 visually engaging, multiple-choice questions.
All choices are touch/mouse-friendly, with optional keyboard shortcuts for accessibility.
Example Flow:

Origin Story
“Who were you before you woke up?”
[ ] Student from Queens
[ ] Punk rocker
[ ] Tech genius
[ ] (etc.)
Core Trait / Archetype
“What’s your strongest quality?”
[ ] Clever
[ ] Brave
[ ] Chaotic
[ ] Compassionate
[ ] (etc.)
Vibe String
“Describe your vibe in a word or phrase.”
[ ] Brooding
[ ] Hopeful
[ ] Anxious but Determined
[ ] (Free text option)
Pronouns/Name (optional, but recommended for immersion/inclusivity)
Quirk or Weakness
“What’s your biggest flaw or secret?”
[ ] Always late
[ ] Haunted by the past
[ ] Can’t resist a challenge
[ ] (etc.)
Result:

Store firm attributes (origin, archetype, pronouns, quirk).
Store fluid “vibe string.”
Show a summary (“As a [punk rocker], you feel [anxious but determined]...”).
2. Dice Rolling Mechanic & Visualizer
After character creation or at key narrative moments, allow the player to roll a “destiny die.”
Mechanics:
Click/tap a large, animated die (SVG or canvas for smooth animation).
Result influences narrative or gives bonuses/penalties.
Visual Feedback:
Satisfying roll animation.
Result is displayed with flavor text (“Fate smiles on you…”).
3. Subconscious/Conscious/Senses Panel
Subconscious Panel:
Show evocative images or “sensory snapshots” (e.g., “You smell rain on concrete…”).
Images and text are dynamically chosen based on character choices and current scene.
Senses Panel:
Optional: Add a “senses” abstraction, e.g., a panel that gives short, atmospheric sensory cues.
HUD:
Bottom pane displays key character info (attributes, vibe string, maybe a small portrait/icon).
4. Implementation Steps
Draft the Character Creation Decision Tree
Write out the conversational flow and choices in a markdown or JSON structure.
Make it easy to extend with new questions or options.
Design Touch-Friendly UI Components
Multi-choice buttons, animated transitions, and summary display.
Dice visualizer as a reusable component.
Integrate Panels
Subconscious/conscious/senses panels update based on choices and game state.
Store Results
Only persist the final choices and “vibe string” for context and replayability.
5. Next Steps/Questions for You
Would you like a draft of the character creation flow as a markdown decision tree, a UI wireframe, or a React component?
Should I prioritize the dice mechanic/visualizer first, or the character creation flow?
Any specific genres, vibes, or “senses” you want to see in the first implementation?
Do you want the “wake up” sequence to be abstract (dreamlike) or more grounded (e.g., waking up in a specific place)?
Let me know your preferences and I’ll start prototyping the next step!
If you want, I can immediately draft the markdown for the character creation decision tree, or begin sketching the dice visualizer React component.

let's skip the origin story, that always reveals itself appropriately as the story unfolds
core trait / archetype might be more compelling to uncover in a conversation in an Internal Family Systems / Pixar Inside Out / Disco Elysium thought cabinet skill kind of way
vibe string will emerge implicitly
pronouns/name will emerge in conversation implicitly
quirk will emerge implicitly

we don't want to be too prescriptive in this discovery, it should unfold in conversation via choices
I think archetype decision tree framed as a series of conversation from various internal "parts" popping into the conversation, and whichever parts the player chooses, will land us on an archetype

Great direction! Here’s a summary and a concrete proposal for how to structure this “archetype via internal conversation” character creation flow, inspired by Internal Family Systems, Inside Out, and Disco Elysium’s Thought Cabinet:

Principles
No explicit origin, pronouns, name, or vibe string up front.
Archetype emerges through a conversational, branching dialogue with various “internal parts” (aspects of self, voices, or subpersonalities).
Player’s choices shape which parts are most influential, leading to an emergent archetype.
Everything unfolds through immersive, in-character dialogue—not menu selection.
Example Structure: “Internal Parts” Conversation Flow
Opening Scene
Player “wakes up” in a liminal, dreamlike space (subconscious panel).
Multiple “internal parts” (e.g., The Protector, The Rebel, The Dreamer, The Analyst, The Caretaker, The Trickster, etc.) pop into the conversation, each offering a perspective or urge.

# Character Creation: Internal Parts Conversation

## Scene 1: Awakening

> You float in darkness. Voices echo within.

### Choices:
- [ ] **Protector:** “We must be careful. The world is dangerous.”
- [ ] **Dreamer:** “There’s so much to discover! Let’s see what’s out there.”
- [ ] **Rebel:** “Rules are made to be broken. Let’s shake things up.”
- [ ] **Caretaker:** “Is everyone okay? We should help someone.”

---

## Scene 2: Response

(Whichever part is chosen becomes more prominent. The next set of voices responds, some new, some recurring.)

> The chosen part’s voice grows stronger. Others chime in.

### Choices:
- [ ] **Analyst:** “Let’s think this through. What’s our plan?”
- [ ] **Trickster:** “Why not try something unexpected?”
- [ ] **Protector** (if not chosen before): “We can’t be too careful.”
- [ ] **Dreamer** (if not chosen before): “Imagine the possibilities…”

---

## Scene 3: Synthesis

- After 2–3 rounds, tally which “parts” the player favored.
- The dominant voices define the emergent archetype (e.g., “Cautious Visionary,” “Chaotic Rebel,” “Compassionate Strategist”).
- This archetype can be referenced in later narrative, but remains fluid.

---

## Implementation Notes

- **No explicit stats—just track which voices were chosen.**
- **Display the “internal conversation” visually:** e.g., floating heads, colored speech bubbles, or shifting background art.
- **Summarize the emergent archetype at the end, or let it subtly flavor the next scene’s narration.**
- **Allow for replayability:** different choices = different archetypes.

---

## Next Steps

- I can draft a full markdown decision tree for this flow, ready for implementation.
- Or, if you’d like, I can sketch a UI wireframe or React component structure for this “internal parts” conversation mechanic.
- Let me know if you want to name or describe the “parts” in a particular way, or if you want to see a specific number of rounds/choices.

one second,

I'm also thinking about maybe allowing dice rolls to determine model temperature, crit 20 would be temperature 0 sane, crit 1 would be temperature (some max threshold we discover, probably 2x a model default to start)

okay reading what you said

Let's refine the character creation process and integrate your ideas into a cohesive plan that emphasizes interactivity, immersion, and a seamless user experience. Here’s a structured approach based on your feedback:

1. Micro Character Creation Flow
Opening Scene: "Wake Up"
Prompt: The game starts with a liminal space, where the player "wakes up."
Visuals: A dreamlike background with soft animations to

please continue

Absolutely! Here’s a continuation and concrete breakdown, integrating your ideas about emergent archetypes and dice-driven temperature for the model:

1. Character Creation: Internal Parts Conversation
Flow Overview
The player “awakens” in a subconscious space.
Internal “parts” (Protector, Dreamer, Rebel, etc.) speak up, each representing a possible archetype.
The player chooses which voices to follow in a branching, conversational style.
No explicit stats or labels are given; the archetype is inferred from choices.
This process is visually engaging and touch/mouse-friendly.

# Character Creation: Internal Conversation

## Scene 1: Awakening

> You drift in a haze. Voices swirl within.

### Choices:
- [ ] **Protector:** “Stay alert. We need to be safe.”
- [ ] **Dreamer:** “Let’s see what wonders await.”
- [ ] **Rebel:** “Let’s break the rules.”
- [ ] **Caretaker:** “Who needs our help?”

---

## Scene 2: Echoes

(Whichever part was chosen, that voice grows stronger. New options appear.)

> The chosen voice resonates. Others respond.

### Choices:
- [ ] **Analyst:** “Let’s consider the facts.”
- [ ] **Trickster:** “Let’s do something wild.”
- [ ] (Repeat any unchosen voices from Scene 1)

---

## Scene 3: Synthesis

- After 2–3 rounds, the game tallies which voices were chosen most.
- The player’s “dominant parts” become their emergent archetype.
- This influences flavor text and possible narrative branches, but remains fluid and not explicitly named unless you want it to be.

---

## 2. Dice Rolling Mechanic: Affecting AI Model Temperature

### Mechanic
- At key moments (e.g., scene transitions, risky choices), the player rolls a virtual die (d20).
- The result sets the “temperature” for the next narrative AI/model call:
  - **Roll 20:** Temperature = 0 (sane, deterministic, grounded)
  - **Roll 1:** Temperature = Max (e.g., 2x model default; wild, surreal, unpredictable)
  - **Rolls 2–19:** Linearly interpolate between min and max temperature.

#### Example Mapping
|
 Roll 
|
 Temperature 
|
|
------
|
-------------
|
|
 20   
|
 0           
|
|
 15   
|
 0.5         
|
|
 10   
|
 1.0         
|
|
 5    
|
 1.5         
|
|
 1    
|
 2.0         
|

- This mechanic gives the player tangible influence over narrative unpredictability and can be visually/sonically satisfying.

### UI/UX
- Dice is large, animated, and touch/mouse-friendly.
- Result is displayed with flavor text (“The world sharpens into focus…” or “Reality blurs and bends…”).
- Optionally, allow the player to “accept fate” or reroll at a cost.

---

## 3. Subconscious/Conscious/Senses Panels

- **Subconscious Panel:**  
  - Shows the internal conversation, floating heads, or colored speech bubbles.
  - Optionally, shows “senses” (e.g., “You feel a chill. The air tastes metallic.”) based on narrative context and archetype.
- **Conscious Panel:**  
  - Main narrative and choices.
- **HUD:**  
  - Subtle, bottom-pane display of emergent traits or “dominant voices.”

---

## 4. Implementation Steps

1. Draft the markdown decision tree for the internal conversation flow.
2. Prototype the dice visualizer (React component, SVG/canvas animation).
3. Integrate the temperature mechanic into narrative generation logic.
4. Update panels to reflect internal dialogue and sensory details.

---

## Next Steps for You

- Would you like a full markdown draft of the internal conversation flow for immediate implementation?
- Should I provide a React component skeleton for the dice visualizer and temperature logic?
- Any specific “parts” or archetypes you want to see in the conversation, or should I propose a set?

Let me know your priorities, and I’ll generate the next concrete artifact!

this feels like the existing workflow we have built for player decisions in the primary game loop, the schema and UI seem to match this, so maybe the challenge here is to determine how to store this in a way that makes it easier to pass to each prompt

let's discuss storage options, I think we have some relevant docs too @RAG_IMPLEMENTATION_STRATEGY.md

this is also interwoven with how we handle dice rolls, but I think we can let the LLM handle that for the time being
