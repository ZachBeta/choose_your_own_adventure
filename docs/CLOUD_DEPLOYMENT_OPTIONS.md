# Fastest & Easiest Cloud Deployment Options for Prototyping

If you want to get your full-stack JavaScript/TypeScript prototype online quickly, reliably, and with minimal cost or configuration, consider the following platforms. These are easier and faster than setting up a traditional VM (like DigitalOcean Droplet) and include free SSL and custom domain support.

## 1. Vercel (Recommended)
- **Frontend:** Deploys React/Vite apps directly from GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.
- **Backend:** Supports serverless API routes (Node.js/Express). For more complex backends, deploy as a separate project.
- **SSL:** Automatic, free, and trusted.
- **Custom Domain:** Supported.
- **Cost:** Generous free tier for prototypes.
- **Ease:** Extremely fast setupâ€”just connect your repo and set environment variables.

**Steps:**
1. Push your code to GitHub.
2. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com), sign up, and import your repo.
3. Set environment variables (`OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, `VITE_API_URL`) in the Vercel dashboard.
4. Vercel auto-builds and deploys your app with a free SSL-enabled URL.

## 2. Netlify
- **Frontend:** Excellent for static sites (React/Vite).
- **Backend:** Supports serverless functions (best for simple APIs, not full Express apps).
- **SSL:** Automatic and free.
- **Custom Domain:** Supported.
- **Cost:** Free tier is good for prototypes.
- **Ease:** Very easy for frontend, backend best for simple APIs.

## 3. Render
- **Frontend:** Deploy static sites with free SSL.
- **Backend:** Supports full Node.js/Express servers as web services (not just serverless).
- **SSL:** Automatic and free.
- **Custom Domain:** Supported.
- **Cost:** Free tier for static sites and web services (auto-sleep on inactivity).
- **Ease:** Slightly more setup than Vercel/Netlify, but still much easier than a VM.

## 4. Railway
- **Frontend/Backend:** Deploy both static sites and Node.js servers with minimal config.
- **SSL:** Automatic and free.
- **Custom Domain:** Supported.
- **Cost:** Good free tier for prototyping.
- **Ease:** Very easy, especially for quick full-stack deployments.

---

## Which Should You Choose?
- **Simple backend (API routes only):** Vercel or Netlify (single repo, serverless functions).
- **Full Express backend:** Render or Railway (deploy as web service).
- **Absolute fastest path:** Vercel is usually the winner for React/Node projects.

## Example: Deploying to Vercel
1. Push your code to GitHub.
2. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com), sign up, and import your repo.
3. Set env variables (`OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, `VITE_API_URL`) in the Vercel dashboard.
4. Vercel auto-builds and deploys your app.
5. Access your app at a free SSL-enabled URL (and add a custom domain if you want).

---

## Notes
- All these platforms provide free SSL and easy custom domain setup.
- You can upgrade to paid tiers later for more resources or always-on services.
- For more control (e.g., custom Nginx config, persistent storage), a VM like DigitalOcean is still an option, but is slower to set up.
