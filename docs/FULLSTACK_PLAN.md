- Coordinate API contracts between frontend and backend
- Handle shared types/interfaces (TypeScript)
- Oversee integration testing

## Detailed Tasks
- Set up a shared types package (for API request/response, DB models)
- Write end-to-end tests (Cypress, Playwright, or similar)
- Coordinate API versioning and error handling conventions
- Ensure CORS, authentication (if added later), and session management work across stack
- Document integration flows and update as needed
