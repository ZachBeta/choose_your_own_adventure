# Implementation Roadmap: For a Senior Engineer

This roadmap assumes strong experience with distributed systems, API design, and developer experience. It focuses on extensibility, resilience, and future-proofing.

---

## Phase 1: Architectural Foundation
- Analyze and validate requirements, documenting assumptions and open questions.
- Establish a monorepo or workspace structure for backend, bot, shared types, and infra (Docker, CI/CD).
- Define architectural boundaries (API, bot, LLM service, data layer) and interfaces.
- Set up robust environment/config management (support for local, staging, prod).

## Phase 2: Discord Bot and API Integration
- Implement the Discord bot with a focus on event-driven architecture and extensibility (command handlers, context routers).
- Ensure the bot is stateless; all game state is managed via API/database.
- Design API endpoints to be idempotent and context-aware, supporting multiplayer and narrative branching.
- Use OpenAPI-driven development for contract-first API design.
- Enforce strict type safety and validation at API boundaries.

## Phase 3: Data and Persistence
- Design a scalable, normalized schema for SQLite with clear migration/versioning strategy.
- Abstract data access through repository or service patterns, supporting future DB swaps.
- Implement comprehensive error handling, observability (metrics/logging), and automated backup/restore for game state.
- Consider sharding or partitioning strategies if scaling beyond SQLite is anticipated.

## Phase 4: LLM & Service Abstraction
- Encapsulate LLM interactions behind a provider-agnostic service interface.
- Support config-driven model selection (Deepseek V3, local, or cloud) and prompt templating.
- Implement circuit breakers, rate limiting, and caching for LLM calls.
- Log and monitor LLM usage for cost and performance optimization.

## Phase 5: Quality, Deployment, and Developer Experience
- Set up CI/CD pipelines for linting, testing, and deployment.
- Write integration and load tests for multiplayer flows and LLM interactions.
- Document system architecture, onboarding, and operational runbooks.
- Plan for A/B testing, feature flags, and staged rollouts.
- Gather analytics and player feedback to inform iterative improvements.

## Engineering Principles
- Design for change: keep modules loosely coupled and highly cohesive.
- Prioritize developer ergonomics and automation.
- Build with observability, security, and privacy in mind from the start.
- Foster a culture of code review, knowledge sharing, and continuous improvement.
