# Swap-Friendly Architecture with SQLite: A Tutorial for Midlevel Engineers

This guide shows you how to build a backend that uses SQLite for storage and can easily swap between local and hosted (API) model-serving for embeddings and image generation. The goal: develop and test locally, then scale or share via cloud with minimal changes.

---

## 1. API Abstraction Layer
- **Create service classes or interfaces** for all model interactions (embedding, image generation, etc).
- Implement both local and remote (API) versions of each service.
  - Local: Calls local model code (Python/Node).
  - Remote: Calls Hugging Face Inference API, Replicate, or your own endpoint.

## 2. Configuration & Environment
- Use environment variables or config files to select which implementation to use:
  - e.g., `MODEL_PROVIDER=local` vs. `MODEL_PROVIDER=api`
- Store API keys, model paths, and endpoints in `.env` files or config objects.

## 3. SQLite as a Universal Storage Layer
- Use SQLite for all persistent data (player state, history, embeddings, etc).
- For vector search, use [sqlite-vss](https://github.com/asg017/sqlite-vss) or a cosine similarity function for small datasets.
- Keep your schema portable (works on dev, CI, and cloud).

## 4. Swappable Service Loader
- Write a loader/factory function to instantiate the correct service based on config:
  ```ts
  function getEmbeddingService() {
    if (process.env.MODEL_PROVIDER === 'local') return new LocalEmbeddingService();
    return new RemoteEmbeddingService();
  }
  ```
- Use this loader everywhere you need embeddings or image generation.

## 5. Consistent API Contracts
- Keep input/output formats identical for both local and remote services.
  - e.g., always return `{ embedding: number[] }` or `{ imageUrl: string }`.

## 6. Local/Remote Parity Testing
- Regularly test both local and remote flows.
- Optionally, write integration tests that run both implementations and compare outputs.

## 7. Deployment Scripts
- Provide scripts for:
  - Local dev: launches SQLite, local model server, and backend.
  - Cloud: launches backend with env set to use remote APIs, same SQLite schema.

## 8. Caching Layer (Optional, Recommended)
- Implement caching for embeddings and generated images, keyed by input.
- Store cache in SQLite or on disk.
- Cache results from both local and remote APIs.

## 9. Logging & Monitoring
- Log which provider is in use, and any errors from model APIs.
- Make it easy to switch providers and debug issues.

## 10. Documentation
- Clearly document:
  - How to switch providers.
  - How to set up SQLite and migrate schema.
  - How to run/test both local and remote flows.

## Example Directory Structure

```
backend/
  services/
    embedding/
      index.ts           # loader/factory
      local.ts           # local implementation
      remote.ts          # remote/API implementation
    image/
      index.ts
      local.ts
      remote.ts
  db/
    schema.sql
    migrate.ts
  .env
  ...
```

## Why This Works
- **Consistent dev/prod experience:** Develop and test everything locally, then deploy to cloud with minimal changes.
- **Portable:** SQLite works everywhere, and your API/service interfaces donâ€™t care where the model runs.
- **Easy to scale:** When you outgrow local, just point your service at a hosted API.

**You now have a backend that is portable, cost-effective, and ready to swap between local and hosted model serving!**
