* the gameplay loop is really clunky, can we discuss caching, and start processing each of the next options, and if they request one that's done, it loads quickly, if they request one that's still calculating they can stream it like normal, that may be complicated
* also on page reload, we can only continue the existing game, we probably need a session or other way to store which player we are using - this will likely require some data model changes that need to be plumbed thru the existing application code 
* it feels like our choices are not leading to an interesting path, it's like being in a dream, but with no control, and it just keeps going deeper and deeper down a path that you're not interested in

* since we now have "experience" working reasonably well, we can remove all the dead code but it's probably worth keeping for now since it allows us to compare prototypes

* create a favicon of some sort of neon d20 in svg with various neon colors for each vertex

* crypto wallet with cheap tokens, that can be used to pay for the game, like inserting a quarter in an arcade
